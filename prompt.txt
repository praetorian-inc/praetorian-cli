  # Praetorian CLI Refactoring Continuation

  You are working on a Python CLI/TUI application for the Praetorian security platform. The codebase has already undergone significant
  refactoring to improve maintainability and eliminate code duplication. Your task is to continue simplifying and refactoring the code to make
  it even cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to extend.

  ## Current Architecture State

  The codebase has been refactored with these improvements:
  - ✅ **Interface adapters eliminated** - Removed unnecessary abstraction layer
  - ✅ **Command core pattern** - Shared business logic in `AegisCommandCore`
  - ✅ **Plugin architecture** - Auto-discovery system for commands
  - ✅ **Strongly-typed help system** - `CommandHelpInfo` dataclass replacing dictionaries
  - ✅ **Distributed help ownership** - Each command owns its help text

  ## Your Refactoring Goals

  Continue simplifying and improving the architecture with these priorities:

  ### 1. **Command Pattern Consolidation**
  - Look for remaining duplication between CLI handlers and TUI commands
  - Consider if the plugin architecture is actually being used effectively or if it's over-engineering
  - Simplify the command registration and discovery mechanisms
  - Evaluate if `AegisCommandCore` can be further streamlined

  ### 2. **SDK Layer Optimization**
  - Review `sdk/entities/aegis.py` for opportunities to simplify business logic
  - Look for methods that could be consolidated or eliminated
  - Check if the Result pattern is being used consistently throughout
  - Consider moving more formatting logic to the SDK layer

  ### 3. **TUI/UI Simplification**
  - Examine if the TUI command classes can be further simplified
  - Look for common patterns that could be extracted to base classes
  - Check if menu.py has unnecessary complexity
  - Consider if completion system and other UI features are overly complex

  ### 4. **Configuration and Settings**
  - Look for hardcoded values that should be configurable
  - Consider centralizing configuration management
  - Check for inconsistent error handling patterns

  ### 5. **Testing and Validation**
  - Identify areas where the code could be more testable
  - Look for complex methods that should be broken down
  - Consider if type hints and validation could be improved

  ## Specific Areas to Investigate

  ### High Priority:
  1. **Plugin System Evaluation**: Is the plugin architecture actually needed, or is it over-engineering? Could command registration be simpler?

  2. **Command Core Usage**: Review how `AegisCommandCore` is being used - is it providing real value or just adding indirection?

  3. **TUI Command Duplication**: Check if there's still duplication between TUI command classes that could be eliminated.

  4. **Error Handling Consistency**: Ensure the Result pattern is used consistently and error handling is unified.

  ### Medium Priority:
  5. **SDK Method Consolidation**: Look for similar methods in the SDK that could be combined.

  6. **Configuration Management**: Centralize settings and configuration.

  7. **Helper Method Extraction**: Look for repeated patterns that could become utility functions.

  ## Refactoring Principles

  Follow these principles:
  - **Favor composition over inheritance** where appropriate
  - **Single Responsibility Principle** - each class/method should have one clear purpose
  - **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - eliminate any remaining duplication
  - **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - prefer simple solutions over complex ones
  - **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)** - remove unused or over-engineered features

  ## Expected Deliverables

  Provide a detailed analysis and implementation plan covering:

  1. **Architecture Assessment**: What can be simplified or eliminated?
  2. **Specific Refactoring Recommendations**: Concrete steps to improve the code
  3. **Code Changes**: Actual implementations of the most impactful improvements
  4. **Testing Strategy**: How to validate that refactoring doesn't break functionality
  5. **Migration Path**: If breaking changes are needed, how to implement them safely

  ## Context Notes

  - This is a security CLI tool, so reliability and clarity are more important than clever abstractions
  - The codebase serves both CLI and TUI interfaces - maintain compatibility with both
  - Developer experience is important - the code should be easy to understand and extend
  - Performance is generally not a primary concern for this CLI application

  Focus on making the code as simple, readable, and maintainable as possible while preserving all current functionality.
