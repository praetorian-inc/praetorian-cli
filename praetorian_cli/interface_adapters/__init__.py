"""
Interface adapters for unified command execution across CLI and TUI.

This module contains interface adapter classes that bridge between different
user interfaces (CLI and TUI) and the underlying business logic (SDK).
These adapters enable the same commands to work consistently across both
contexts while adapting output formatting and state management appropriately.
